Installation
============

It is recommended, especially if you do not have administrative privileges, to use an 
`Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_ Python distribution.

Install the development version of enviropy with ``pip``.

::
    
    pip install git+https://github.com/jentjr/enviropy.git


Eventually, a ``conda`` package will be created.
